// # Homework: The Word Guesser
// You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).
// - Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '\_', '\_', '\_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
// - Write a function called guessLetter that will:
// - Take one argument, the guessed letter.
// - Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
// - If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
// - When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')
// and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
// - It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed,
// and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
// - Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.
const winWord = ["t", "r", "a", "p"];
const guessed = [];
const guessLetter = function (guess) {
	for (let i = 0; i < winWord.length; i++) {
		if (guessed.length != winWord.length) {
			if (guess === winWord[i]) {
				guessed.push(guess);
				console.log(`well done ${guess} is correct u have letters: ${guessed}`);
			}
		} else console.log(`game over you win word was ${winWord}`);
	}
};
// using guessLetter() in the terminal it works well. im not sure how to order them and have blank spaces in corect spots..
// guessLetter();

// i might try the extra bonus stuff on the weekend if i have time

// ## Bonus: Make it more like Wheel of Fortune:
// - Start with a reward amount of $0
// - Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), otherwise subtract from their reward.
// - When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.

// ## Bonus: Make it like Hangman:
// - Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
// - Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0), and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.
// - Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a hangman), inform the user that they lost and show a hangman on the log.
